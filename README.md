# Sober Mirror 
This is pretty much just a mirror to pull the Flatpak repository file from just in case the main one decided to screw over by Cloudflare.

## What is the remote link?
If you're not willing to install by file, the remote link is `https://k1yrix.github.io/sober-mirror/sober.flatpakref`. Just input this into the terminal to install. (use the main one first (`https://sober.vinegarhq.org/sober.flatpakref`))
